# Meningioma

Questions
---------

1. Should pre-process the data, or can we convert the NIFTI images to Numpy arrays and work with those?
  - If we should pre-process, what is the general workflow for that?
1. How could we annotate where in the brain the meningioma exists? (i.e. how could we create training data for supervised learning?)
1. Do all scans involve a contrast agent?
1. Are there any Python packages I should look into other than scikit-learn?
1. We get different results if we resize the image. Should we use the original image size?
